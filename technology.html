<h2><b>New Mobile Application/Website</b></h2>
<h3><b>About Our New App/Website:</b></h3>
<p>To better serve our customers, we are currently
working on developing our own mobile application/website.
This will allow customers to contact represenatives through
instant messaging. Our represenatives will soon be able to help
several customers at once without anyone having to wait a significant time.
We will still be assisting customers over the phone and in person,
but this option may be convenient for some customers who don't have the time for a phone call.</p>

<p>We will also be allowing customers to make user profiles and upload pictures of cars they would
like to sell to the dealership. We will also upload pictures/details of cars that are for sale that customers can view 
so they can have an idea of what they want before they come to the dealership. This will save customers some time
and answer many of their questions before they even get here.</p>

<p>Appointments will also be able to be scheduled through the app/site. They can also be cancelled/rescheduled.
This will make it easier for customers to know what is available without having to call, and they can plan around their schedules.</p>

<p>Customers will even be able to order and purchase cars online. Trade-ins will also
be an option. We will also have an option to order parts online, as well as make payments.</p>

<p>Overall, our app/website will be like a social media site for cars. Since many people use
social media on a daily basis, including most of our employees, we think this will be a great way 
to relate to our customers. We expect the app to be ready by Spring 2017, so stay tuned. We hope you are as excited as we are.</p>
