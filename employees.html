<p>Danny is a valuable asset to our team. He has been with us for 12 years and continues to do a great job.
He is great with older customers, as well as those who don't know much about cars.
He is great at explaining things so they are simple and clear, which makes us proud to know our customers can
understand anything they want to know about cars, even with no prior knowledge!</p>

<p>Paul is one of our newer employees, but he is very promising and doing outstanding work so far.
He goes above and beyond every day, doing research online about cars during his lunch breaks. He is also
great at bringing in the younger crowd. He relates well to young people who are a little nervous about buying their first car.</p>

<p>Barbara is a wonderful employee and asset to our team. She always makes people smile,
and is great with families and older couples. She also loves to bake, which means we
always have amazing fresh baked-goods around holidays. Everyone enjoys having Barbara on our team,
and she always does a wonderful job.</p>

<h4><b>Harry Reid</b></h4>
<img src="harry.png" alt="Logo" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">
<p>Harry is definitely one of the most technical members on our team. We often rely 
on him to help customers who are looking for something with very specific features, 
since Harry is great at finding cars, even for people who are very picky or totally unsure 
of what they want. He has helped several customers who had no idea what they were looking for find
the car of their dreams in under half an hour. He is a wonderful member of our team.</p>
<br></br>
<h3><b>Support Staff:</b></h3>
<h4><b>Erlich Bachman</b></h4>
<img src="erlich.png" alt="Logo" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">
<p>Erlich is one of our newer team members. He is great with computers, and that is
exciting because he is heavily involved in our company's decision to incorporate more
technology. He is also always on top of our website, keeping it up to date. He is another
great asset to this team.</p>
<br></br>
<h4><b>Willy Fixit</b></h4>
<img src="willy.png" alt="Logo" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">
<p>Willy is our wonderful mechanic. Every day, he works on more cars than we thought possible,
and he always does an amazing job. Even on busy days when he has to handle many appointments and walk-ins on top 
of it, he gets the job done. He also gave us the wonderful idea to use our website to let people know which days
we are extra busy, that way our customers can plan accordingly. He offers much more to this team than his skills as a mechanic,
always offering great ideas to improve our dealership.</p>
